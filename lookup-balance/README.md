### Balance Lookup Script
This script is a simple tool to check the balance of a given address on a blockchain network. It uses the quais library (as an assumption as no official link provided for quais) to interact with the blockchain network, the type-flag library for parsing command line arguments, and the getShardFromAddress function to determine the shard from which to query the balance.

Prerequisites
Before you can run this script, you must install Node.js and npm. Once you have installed these, run the following command to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
npm install quais type-flag
```
Usage
You can specify the address to check the balance of using the -a or --address command line flag. For example, to check the balance of the address 0x1234..., you would run:

```bash
ts-node lookup-balance.ts -a 0x1234...
```
Replace 0x1234... with the actual address you want to check.

The script will then:

Use the getShardFromAddress function to determine the shard that contains the given address.
Load the node data for the shard from a predefined allNodeData object.
Connect to the blockchain network using the provider from the node data.
Query the balance of the given address.
Log the address and balance to the console.
Note
Please ensure that the allNodeData object and the getShardFromAddress function are properly defined and that they can correctly determine the shard and provider for a given address. If they cannot, the script may not be able to connect to the correct provider and query the balance.
